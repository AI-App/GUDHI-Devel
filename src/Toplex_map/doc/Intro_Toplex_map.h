 * \section toplexmapdefinition Definition
 * 
 * Let's consider a simplicial complex, denote by $d$ its dimension
 * and by $k$ its number of maximal simplices.
 * Furthermore, denote by $\gamma_0$ the maximal number of toplices, i.e. maximal simplices,
 * that contain a same vertex.
 *
 * The goal of the Toplex Map is both to represent the complex in optimal
 * O(kd) space and to provide fast standard operations such as : insertion, removal
 * and membership of a simplex, contraction of an edge, collapses. The time needed
 * for these operation is linear or quadratic in $\gamma_0$ and $d$.
 *
 * Toplex map is composed firstly of a raw storage of toplices and secondly of a
 * map which associate any vertex to a set of pointers toward all toplices
 * containing this vertex.
