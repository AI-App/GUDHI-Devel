 * \section toplexmapdefinition Definition
 *
 * A Toplex_map is a data structure to represent and store a simplicial complex. A "toplex" is the contraction of
 * "top-simplex", also known as a maximal simplex. We will call "toplices" a set of "toplex".
 *
 * Let's consider a simplicial complex, denote by \f$d\f$ its dimension and by \f$k\f$ its number of maximal simplices.
 * Furthermore, denote by \f$\gamma_0\f$ the maximal number of toplices, i.e. maximal simplices, that contain a same
 * vertex.
 *
 * The goal of the Toplex Map is both to represent the complex in optimal O(kd) space and to provide fast standard
 * operations such as : insertion, removal, contraction of an edge, collapses and membership of a simplex. The time
 * needed for these operation is linear or quadratic in \f$\gamma_0\f$ and \f$d\f$.
 *
 * Toplex map is composed firstly of a raw storage of toplices and secondly of a map which associate any vertex to a
 * set of pointers toward all toplices containing this vertex.

 *
 * The performances are a lot better than the `Simplex_tree` as soon you use maximal simplices and not simplices.
