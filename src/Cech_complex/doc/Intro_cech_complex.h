 * 
 * Cech_complex
 * <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cech_cohomology">(Wikipedia)</a> is a
 * proximity graph that allows to construct a
 * <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex">simplicial complex</a>
 * from it.
 * The input can be a point cloud with a given distance function.
 * 
 * The filtration value of each edge is computed from a user-given distance function.
 * 
 * All edges that have a filtration value strictly greater than a given threshold value are not inserted into
 * the complex.
 * 
 * When creating a simplicial complex from this proximity graph, Cech inserts the proximity graph into the data
 * structure, and then expands the simplicial complex when required.
 *
 * Vertex name correspond to the index of the point in the given range (aka. the point cloud).
 * 
 * \image html "cech_complex_representation.png" "Cech complex proximity graph representation"
 * 
 * On this example, as edges (4,5), (4,6) and (5,6) are in the complex, simplex (4,5,6) is added with the filtration
 * value set with \f$max(filtration(4,5), filtration(4,6), filtration(5,6))\f$.
 * And so on for simplex (0,1,2,3).
 * 
 * If the Cech_complex interfaces are not detailed enough for your need, please refer to
 * <a href="_persistent_cohomology_2cech_persistence_step_by_step_8cpp-example.html">

 * 
 * \subsection cechpointscloudexample Example from a point cloud and a distance function
 * 
 * This example builds the proximity graph from the given points, threshold value, and distance function.
 * Then it creates a `Simplex_tree` with it.
 * 
 * Then, it is asked to display information about the simplicial complex.
 * 
 * \include Cech_complex/cech_complex_example_from_points.cpp
 * 
 * When launching (Cech maximal distance between 2 points is 7.1, is expanded until dimension 2):
 * 
 * \code $> ./Cech_complex_example_from_points
 * \endcode
 *
 * the program output is:
 * 
 * \include Cech_complex/cech_complex_example_from_points_for_doc.txt
