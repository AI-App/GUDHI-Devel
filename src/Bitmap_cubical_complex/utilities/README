## `Bitmap_cubical_complex` ##
This program computes persistent homology, by using the Bitmap_cubical_complex class, of cubical complexes provided in text files in Perseus style. The only number in the first line is a dimension D of a bitmap. In the lines I between 2 and D+1 there are numbers of top dimensional cells in the direction I. Let N denote product of the numbers in the lines between 2 and D. In the lines D+2 to D+2+N there are filtrations of top dimensional cells. We assume that the cells are in the lexicographical order.

Examples:

* Create a Cubical Complex from the Perseus style file CubicalOneSphere.txt, computes Persistence cohomology from it and writes the results in a persistence file:
`Bitmap_cubical_complex data/bitmap/CubicalOneSphere.txt`

* Create a Cubical Complex from the Perseus style file CubicalTwoSphere.txt, computes Persistence cohomology from it and writes the results in a persistence file:
`Bitmap_cubical_complex data/bitmap/CubicalTwoSphere.txt`

## `Bitmap_cubical_complex_periodic_boundary_conditions` ##

Same as above, but with periodic boundary conditions.

Examples:

* Create a Periodical Cubical Complex from the Perseus style file 2d_torus.txt, computes Persistence cohomology from it and writes the results in a persistence file:
`Bitmap_cubical_complex_periodic_boundary_conditions.exe data/bitmap/2d_torus.txt`

* Create a Periodical Cubical Complex from the Perseus style file 3d_torus.txt, computes Persistence cohomology from it and writes the results in a persistence file:
`Bitmap_cubical_complex_periodic_boundary_conditions.exe data/bitmap/3d_torus.txt`
