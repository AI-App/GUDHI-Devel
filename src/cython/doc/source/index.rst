Introduction
************

The Gudhi library (Geometry Understanding in Higher Dimensions) is a generic
open source C++ library for Computational Topology and Topological Data
Analysis (TDA). The GUDHI library intends to help the development of new
algorithmic solutions in TDA and their transfer to applications. It provides
robust, efficient, flexible and easy to use implementations of
state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures.

The current release of the GUDHI library includes:

* Data structures to represent, construct and manipulate simplicial complexes.
* Algorithms to compute persistent homology and multi-field persistent homology.
* Simplication of simplicial complexes by edge contraction.

All data-structures are generic and several of their aspects can be
parameterized via template classes. We refer to [14] for a detailed
description of the design of the library.
