 * Kernels are generalized scalar products. They take the form of functions whose evaluations on pairs of persistence diagrams are equal
 * to the scalar products of the images of the diagrams under some feature map into a (generally unknown and infinite dimensional)
 * Hilbert space. Kernels are
 * very useful to handle any type of data for algorithms that require at least a Hilbert structure, such as Principal Component Analysis
 * or Support Vector Machines. In this package, we implement three kernels for persistence diagrams: the Persistence Scale Space kernel,
 * the Persistence Weighted Gaussian kernel and the Sliced Wasserstein kernel.
